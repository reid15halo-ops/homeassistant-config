    \U0001F642\n\n<details> <summary><b>The Automation Process:</b> \U0001F448</summary>\n\n\n
    \ - **Use Case:**\n    - Media (Cinema Room): Turn on different lights when watching
    a movie.\n    - House Alarm: Turn on lights when your house alarm has been activated.\n
    \   - Smoke Detector: Turn on lights and exhaust fans when the smoke detector
    has been activated.\n\n\nThe example below is suitable for movie nights or use
    in a cinema room. Additionally, it can be used to turn on lights when your house
    alarm has been activated or activate lights and exhaust fans when a smoke detector
    has been triggered.\n\n\n  - **Movie Start (Playing):**\n    - Lights, switches,
    scenes and scripts are activated to a customizable movie mode when a movie starts.\n
    \   - You can also specify the app used in the media player (e.g., Apple TV, Netflix,
    etc.) and only activate the automation if these apps are used.\n    - Optionally,
    you can select which lights and switches to be turned off at the start of the
    movie.\n    - Optionally, you can also choose to create a snapshot of your lights
    and switches before the movie starts, allowing you to return them to their original
    state after the movie ends.\n\n  - **Delay Time:**\n    - The delay time is a
    buffer period before the automation switches OFF or enters an intermission mode.
    It provides a grace period to rectify accidental actions, like mistakenly pressing
    the wrong button on the remote, which might unintentionally turn the automation
    OFF or trigger the intermission mode.\n\n  - **Intermission:**\n    - Intermission
    allows for versatile lighting adjustments, including turning on different lights,
    adjusting brightness levels, changing colour temperature, RGB colour settings,
    or selecting specific scenes or scripts. It's particularly handy for setting slightly
    brighter lights during an intermission break when pausing a movie. \n\n  - **Movie
    End:**\n    - When the movie ends, all lights, switches, scenes and scripts are
    turned off. Alternatively, if you're using the automation link option, your sensor
    light automation will be activated, returning your lights to your sensor light
    automation settings.\n    - Optionally, you can select any lights, switches, scenes
    or scripts to be turned on after the movie ends.\n    - If you have chosen to
    create a snapshot of your lights and switches at the start, they will be returned
    to their original state when the movie ends.\n\n  - **Automation Link Option:**\n
    \   - The 'Automation Link Option' seamlessly integrates with other blueprints,
    such as the \U0001F4A1 'Sensor Light Blueprint', allowing you to disable additional
    automations when a movie is activated. This feature takes control of the lights,
    switches, scenes, and scripts, ensuring a smooth movie experience. Once the movie
    ends, the other automations are re-enabled, restoring the lights, switches, scenes,
    and scripts to their normal operation.\n\n  - **Manual Override:**\n    - Utilize
    'Bypass Options' for manual bypassing of trigger sensors, providing manual control
    and additional customization.\n\n  - **Sun Elevation Options:**\n    - Implement
    'Sun Elevation' to restrict automation to darker conditions aligned with the sun's
    position.\n\n  - **Ambient Light Sensing Options:**\n    - Set up an Ambient Light
    Sensor for activation in low-light conditions, customizable with specified LUX
    values.\n    \n  - **Blueprint Add-On Integration:**\n      - \U0001F4A1 Sensor

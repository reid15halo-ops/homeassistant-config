Kiffzimmer (Smartplug, Smartplug, Lichtstreifen, Rollladen, Door sensor)


Dashboard for Cannabis growing (it is legal in germany). I have one sensor per Plant (i have 3) every of this sensor is metering the water content of the soil (not humidity) and temperature. The Aktivkohlefilter is controlled via a smart plug to increase/decrease the humidity and temperature. Heizlüfter is also controlled via smart plug to change the temperature and hold it in the best intervalls for each growing stage. I grow strawberry lemonade strain from barneys farm and have a motherplant to cut sapplings from it. 🍓🍋 Strain Profile: Strawberry LemonadeThis strain is a powerful Sativa-dominant powerhouse, famous for its massive yields and intense terpene profile that literally smells like sweet strawberry lemonade.1FeatureDetailsBreederBarney's FarmGeneticsStrawberry x Lemon OGTypeSativa Dominant (60% Sativa / 40% Indica)THC ContentVery High (20% – 24%+)Flowering Time60–70 Days (Indoor)Harvest (Outdoor)Early to Mid-OctoberYield (Indoor)High (Up to 700g/m²)Yield (Outdoor)Massive (Up to 2.5kg per plant)Height120–150cm (Indoor) | Up to 250cm (Outdoor)Experience & CharacteristicsAroma & Flavor: True to its name, this strain explodes with sweet, sugary lemon notes and earthy strawberry undertones.2 You may also detect hints of fruity hash and skunk.Effects: A classic daytime Sativa buzz.3 It is energetic, uplifting, and creative. It provides a focused "head high" that eventually settles into a relaxing body stone without the couch-lock, making it excellent for social activities or creative work.4Growth Structure: It grows vigorously with a tower-like Sativa structure.5 It has long branches and substantial internodal spacing (the gap between branches), which allows for good airflow but requires height management.Resilience: Excellent. Barney's Farm rates this strain very high for resistance to mold (Botrytis), spider mites, and cold weather, making it a forgiving choice for varying climates.6🌱 Stage-by-Stage Growing Guide & EnvironmentWhile this strain is rated as "Easy" due to its pest/mold resistance, it is a vigorous Sativa that can get tall quickly.7 Controlling the environment is key to managing its stretch and maximizing those massive yields.1. Germination StageGoal: distinct pop and taproot emergence.Temp: 24°C – 26°C (75°F – 78°F)Humidity (RH): 70% – 80% (Use a humidity dome if possible).Light: Low intensity. If using LEDs, keep them dimmed or raised high.Tip: Do not let the medium dry out, but avoid drowning the seed.2. Seedling Stage (Weeks 1–2)Goal: Establish a root system.Temp: 22°C – 25°C (72°F – 77°F). Avoid drops below 20°C at night.Humidity (RH): 65% – 70%.8Light: 18 hours ON / 6 hours OFF.9Nutrients: None or very mild root boosters only.Airflow: Gentle breeze to strengthen the stems, but do not point fans directly at the fragile seedlings.3. Vegetative Stage (Weeks 3–5+)Goal: Structural growth and height management.Temp: 21°C – 28°C (70°F – 82°F).10 Sativas tolerate heat reasonably well.Humidity (RH): 55% – 65%.Nutrients: Nitrogen-rich. Note: Some growers report this strain can be hungry for CalMag (Calcium-Magnesium), so keep an eye out for rusty spots on leaves.Training (Crucial): Because Strawberry Lemonade can reach 150cm indoors, you must train it.Topping: Cut the main stem early to force bushier growth.LST: Tie down branches to keep the canopy even.4. Early Flowering (Stretch Phase)Goal: Manage the "stretch" (the plant can double in size).Temp: 20°C – 26°C (68°F – 78°F).11Humidity (RH): Drop to 50% – 55%.Light: Switch to 12/12 cycle.Support: Prepare trellis nets or bamboo stakes. The buds on this strain get heavy and long; the branches will need support to prevent snapping.125. Late Flowering / Ripening (Weeks 6–9)Goal: Density and Resin production.Temp: 18°C – 24°C (65°F – 75°F). Slightly cooler temps preserve the fruity terpenes.Humidity (RH): 40% – 45%. Although it is mold resistant, lower humidity is safer for the dense colas.Nutrients: Switch to P-K (Phosphorus/Potassium) boosters. Flush with pure water for the last 1–2 weeks to ensure the "Lemonade" flavor is clean and not chemical.💡 Pro Tips for SuccessOdor Control: This strain is loud. It produces a very pungent fruity smell late in flower. A quality carbon filter is mandatory indoors.Height Warning: If you have a short grow tent (under 180cm), flip to flower early (when the plant is about half the desired final size) to account for the Sativa stretch.Harvest Window: Don't rush. Wait until the trichomes are cloudy/milky. Harvesting too early will result in a racy/anxious high; waiting for full maturity brings out the complex strawberry profile.

I dont want to get sedating cannabis but more a "all day" weed where I can still easy manage all daily buisness at ease with less stress

All automations for the cannabis or Kiffzimmer should be optimized for especially this strain.
